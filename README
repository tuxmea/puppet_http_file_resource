=== puppet http fetch function ===

use any http server as source for files.

we define a new function called fetch() use them as source in file resources

e.g.

file {
	path 	=> "/tmp/testfile",
	owner	=> root,
	group	=> root,
	mode	=> 644,
	content	=> fetch("http://www.yourwebserver.com/path/filename"),
}



=== Open tasks: ===

the fetch function _always_ fetches the remote file. puppet compares the donwloaded with the actual file.

This is not useful for large files (e.g. iso images).

Therefore we need to define a custom resource with the following functionality:


how do we check for updates:

we require curl and wget to be available.

1. check for latest file:
we do not use md5sum or any other hashes. we fully rely upon the information from the http server.

curl -D headers --range 0-100 $source

cat headers

Look for Last-Modified header. (make sure to convert any given timezone)


2. Check local file
if $path is not available:

use wget to fetch $source

if $path is available:

read ctime (ls -l) and verify against information from curl Last Modified header

if Last Modified header is not the same: use wget to fetch the file.
